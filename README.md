# StonyBrook-Senior_Design
For my senior design project, my team and I designed a Da-Vinci style arch bridge made out of bamboo to be constructed for a village in Madagascar. To help expedite
the design process, I created a few scripts in Matlab which could quickly verify the structural integrity of our bridge. Each script showcases some the fundamental 
engineering princples that I learned during my undergraduate career and how they could be implemented programatically to solve challenging problems.
